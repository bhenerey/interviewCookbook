CONGRATULATIONS! You are about to begin the Operations Engineering Remote Technical Test!

YOUR MISSION, should you choose to accept it, is as follows:

0) Connect (ssh) to the server which was emailed to you. You should also have received the username and password necessary. 

1) Install Wordpress. (Wordpress web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog). Not familiar with Wordpress? http://lmgtfy.com/?q=wordpress

2) Make this work: http://<FQDN>/wordpress/ Amazingly, someone recently didn't know what an FQDN was, so here you go: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FQDN

That's it. 
Rules and important Notes are below. 
PLEASE follow them. 
They contain everything you need to know. 
Seriously. 



RULES:

You may not ask others for help.
You can use books, Google, whatever. 
You have sudo root access. 
You have 1 hour. You will be timed. The faster you finish the better.
For this task you can be as destructive as you'd like. If you need to remove/reinstall something instead of modify/fix it, it's okay. 

BUG: 
Please don't connect with more than 1 ssh session. We're recording your session with screen, and I didn't have time to get multiple sessions writing to different log files. 

NOTA BENE:

We've done a few annoying things to make this task a bit less trivial. Do not assume this server is in a good state. 
The server you're accessing will self-destruct. Don't worry about breaking it. Of course, if you break it without completing the mission, you fail. 

A NOTE ABOUT SCREEN:

1) You're ssh session with be using a Screen XTERM. You won't be able to use a mousewheel to scroll through your emulator buffer. Instead, use Control-A ESC to enter Copy Mode. You can then use the arrows to move around. ESC will exit Copy Mode. 
2) Your screen session is logged to a text file. If you exit screen, we won't be able to see how you solved the problem. That's as good as failing. Better you reattach to screen.
